2. Install all packages by typing npm install
3. Read through the instructions and specs to understand the task
4. Run specs with npm test
5. Implement the code in bubble-sort.js.

Polya's Problem Solving

Remember Polya's problem solving framework as you go through these exercises.

    Understand the problem
    Make a plan
    Carry out the plan
    Look back and improve your solution

You will be implementing classic algorithms in code. Review the readings to understand the problem.

You are given the plan in comments already. Study these carefully!

These exercises are meant for you to practice carrying out the plan. Focus on translating the plans to JavaScript code.

If you finish early, you will be able to improve your solutions by refactoring your sorting algorithms to run in-place.
Part 2: Bubble Sort

Read through the pseudo-code to implement bubble sort.

This exercise makes use of console.log to make sure that your implementations of bubble sort is correct. Note each intermediate state of the arrays in test/sort-specs.js.

If you follow the pseudocode, your console.log outputs will match the order in the specs.

BONUS Time and plot the performance on a Google Sheet.
